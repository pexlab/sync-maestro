# Sync Maestro

Sync Maestro is an innovative, high-precision synchronization tool designed to control audio, video, and other time-sensitive operations across multiple machines. This project consists of four integral applications that work in conjunction to enable precise, synchronized functionality. The applications leverage a microcontroller's capabilities to send a "tick" signal to the client machines, effectively syncing their operations.

## Components

### Client App (`apps/client`)

The Client application is a lightweight, efficient software that resides on each machine requiring synchronized playback of audio/video content. It listens for the tick signal from the Sync Maestro's microcontroller and aligns the machine's actions according to the received ticks.

### Instructor App (`apps/instructor`)

The Instructor application acts as the maestro in the system, providing cues to each client about the tick they should anticipate. It contains the intelligence to guide each client about the position they should be at, or the actions they should be performing at each tick. This is where the synchronisation instructions are laid down.

### Supervisor App (`apps/supervisor`)

The Supervisor application is essentially the administration dashboard, providing an overview of the entire installation. It provides a detailed visual interface to track the performance, status, and synchronization of each client machine. It's the bird's-eye view for the management of the Sync Maestro installation.

### Timer App (`apps/timer`)

The Timer application is the heart of Sync Maestro. It contains the AVR assembly code that manages the microcontroller, which is responsible for sending the tick signals. This application ensures that the ticks are issued at the precise moment, maintaining the integrity of the entire synchronization system.
